			<h2 class="H2">Cricket 🏏</h2>
			<p class="C1">It is my favourite sport! I have been playing cricket since I was 8 years old. I had played for my school cricket team for 6 consecutive years. I also was the captain for 2 seasons. I have met a few famous cricketers such as Brett Lee, Mathew Hayden, Shane Watson and Mohammed Shami.

			<p class="F2">I have even done an internship at a Food Tech Start-up called Waitrr. I learnt a lot about the F&B industry. I got insight on what happens behind the scenes, how technology is changing ths industry and how people are consuming their food from restaurants. This internship was done in Singapore.</p>

			<h3 class="T2"> Check out the blogs I wrote about F&B during my Internship!</h3>

			<h2 class="T3">Environmental Sutainability 🌳</h2>
			<p class="ES1">Climate change is real! Even though I am not a full-fleged environmentalist I still try my best to be sustainable and conservative as much as possible. For example, turning of the switches, turning on the tap only when needed, less plastic products, reusable face masks, etc. I believe this is a very important problem facing our planet and we all need to change our ways for a brighter future. My dream is too one day plant 30 to 50 trees. </p>
